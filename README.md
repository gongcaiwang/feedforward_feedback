# feedforward_feedback

this repo corresponds the speech decoding framework in the paper "Distributed Feedforward and Feedback Cortical Processing Supports Human Speech Production" https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.06.471521v1.
## speech decoding 
"speech_decoding/" folder is for speech decoding model trainig and testing. Please refer to "speech_decoding/README.md" for more details.

## feedforward and feedback analysis
"fig3.m", "fig4.m", "fig5.m" are the script for the feedforward and feedback analysis that relates to some of the main plots in the paper.

"fig3.m" relates to "Figure 3", the feedforward and feedback contribution analysis.

"fig4.m" relates to "Figure 4", Spatial-temporal receptive fields based on decoding contribution.

"fig5.m" relates to "Figure 5", The temporal receptive field across anatomical regions.
